      <big
        >BMI is not used for muscle builders, long distance athletes, pregnant
        women, the elderly or young children. <br />
        This is because BMI does not take into account whether the weight is
        carried as muscle or fat, just the <br />
        number. Those with a higher muscle mass, such as athletes, may have a
        high BMI but not be at greater <br />
        health risk. Those with a lower muscle mass, such as children who have
        not completed their growth or the <br />
        elderly who may be losing some muscle mass may have a lower BMI. During
        pregnancy and lactation, a <br />
        woman's body composition changes, so using BMI is not appropriate.</big
